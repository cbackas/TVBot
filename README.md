# TVbot

TvVbot is a bot build specifically for the Discord server "The Lounge" (https://discord.gg/lounge). The bot was built around the idea of keeping track of currently airing TV shows so that users on the server can recieve reminders about currently airing shows. This was expanded on to allow TV/Movie/Actor lookup commands with data from Trakt and IMDB. The bot was then built to adopt all the tasks of the various other publicly available bots on the server.
